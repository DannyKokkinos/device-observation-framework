# device-observation-framework
This repository contains the WAVE Device Observation Framework. The DPCTF Device Observation Framework determines pass or fail results, based on observations taken of tests which are run on a device by the DPCTF Test Runner.  DPCTF is the Device Playback Compatibility Task Force of the CTA WAVE Project (https://CTA.tech/WAVE and standards@CTA.tech for more info).
